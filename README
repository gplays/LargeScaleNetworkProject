Welcome to our brand new git project.

The goal of this project is to analyse a large scale citation network.
The graph will be preprocessed and new features will be computed for the nodes.
From these features we will define new metrics to compute centrality, closeness, betweeness and clustering.
The metrics should be defined in such a way that it is related to the probability that a paper cite another.
